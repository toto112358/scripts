This directory contains files for kernels for DEC VAX machines on mercury.
Icarus files are used for microvax II machines running Fujitsu Eagle (2351A)
disk drives operating on an Emulex controller and set up as RA81's with 
slightly different partition sizes.  Jones files are for the old VAX750
machines also running Fujitsu Eagle (2351A) drives.  Moria files are for
Microvax II machines running an Emulex controller for SMD disks but uses
RA81 partitioning.  The icarus files are currently used on all three of
these machines as they are all microvax II's with Emulex controllers and
Eagle drives and are more or less identical.  The other files are kept
merely for historical purposes at this point.
