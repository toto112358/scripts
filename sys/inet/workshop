I guess it depends on how you view the "panels".  Kens view says that
these are, essentially, a group presentation with some discussion
afterwards.  My view is that the panels are more dialogue and Q&A.

I agree with trying to divide this into a subgroup.  Any (or all) can
get involved, but I'll make bets that some of you don't really care
(or at least don't want to participate).  As for conference calls...
every time I have one it always winds up that half the people can't
hear the other half and its more frustrating than useful.  Let's stick
with email.

I would like to have this resolved ASAP so we can also decide how many
presentors there will be.  It's almost time to send out acceptance/
rejection letters.

On another note... The Campbell paper is being mailed to all of you
today, along with registration and housing request forms.  Some of
you have already returned the registration forms, so you can
ignore the duplication (its not worth my time to make up selective
packets).
